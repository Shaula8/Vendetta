# Vendetta

This project involves the implementation of a website aimed at showcasing the film "V for Vendetta". 

Within the scope of this project, my goal was to practice various web programming concepts learned during one of the semesters of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Among these concepts were coding in HTML for the structure of my code as well as formatting using CSS. It's also worth noting that the majority of the project's structure is mainly inspired by codes available on Bootstrap along with the use of the jQuery library.
